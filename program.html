        <h3>EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS</h3>
        <p>The main motive of YouWe is to promote sex education in every educational institution , sex education will be
          given on three levels. Primary, secondary and tertiary levels of sex education according to the age of the
          individual or group of individuals. Lack of sex education is main cause of rape . Whenever people hear the
          word 'sex' the general social taboo comes in our mind , or about sex education people just assume that we are
          talking about intercourse.Intercourse is a very mere part of sex education. Infact it is not all related to
          intercourse.
          <!--  Intercourse is a very mere part of sex education. Infact it is not all related to intercourse. Lack of proper Knowledge among youth and the taboos about gender differences can provoke one to do some Immoral acts. Education is not just the bookish knowledge . People think not Educating kids about these things will save them , but that’s not true at all, not telling them about these things is a bad decision, we have to aware them about the seriousness aof these topics. -->

        <h3>AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS</h3>
        <p>
          The team of YouWe will and has conducted several awareness campaigns covering different topics which are
          needed to discuss.Breaking all the social taboos and assumptions , in form of nukad nataks and skits. YouWe
          has already conducted awareness camps on mensuration and rape. Telling about the norms and myth related to to
          mensuration and the breaking them. Lack of awareness is the one of the biggest reasons that we have such
          problems in the society. People lack knowledge and they build norms and taboos about things.

        <p>
          What could be better than helping a person in need . We help poor and needy people . We raise donation camps
          and collect clothes and food from the people willing to give . And then we distribute the clothes collected
          from donation camps to the needy people. We also go on collection drives and pick up the things from the
          donor’s place . YouWe has already conducted 5 cloth donation drives and 1 food distribution drive and has many
          such drives coming up to help the needy people of the city.
          <!-- We are trying to fill up the gap between the needy people and the givers . -->

        <p>
          Communication is the solution to all the problems. YouWe is creating a helpline, a secure place to build a
          bridge between the survivors and our people so we could listen to your problems and find the best solution.
          Many a times victims are not heard as their voice is suppressed , they are not allowed to speak for themselves
          and fight for justice. There are thousands of unregistered cases in India which are needed to come in light.
          We the people of YouWe will listen to everything happened with you and our team will strive to get you
          justice.
